                    <p className="bio-content">I am a Southern California native fueled by a love for creating. I am captivated by the challenge of developing something that is just as beautiful as it is functional. I love the complete freedom I have to visualize and cultivate projects from a simple idea to a cool, funky website. </p>
                    <p className="bio-content">I believe that less is more when it comes to website design. Prioritizing deliberate and meaningful content, allows the user experience to be uncluttered and simple. My goal is to build websites that are effortless to navigate and enticing to explore.  </p>
                    <p className="bio-content">To stay relevant in an evolving industry, I research web dev trends popping up on Instagram and Pinterest. This allows me to keep up with  modern aesthetics, that I can later implement in new projects.</p>
                    <p className="bio-content">My foundational languages are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In my early work I worked with Bootstrap components as a quick way to make fun, simple websites. I am currently trying my hand with React JS and have been loving it, and I plan on playing more about React with my upcoming projects.</p>
                    <p className="bio-content">In my free time I love to do yoga, FaceTime my family, and watch movies with my husband.  My favorite foods are papusas and Chinese takeout--the greasier the better. I love to travel and hope to one day visit Thailand and India.  </p>
